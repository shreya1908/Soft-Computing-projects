# Project 1:
We frequently become mired in the name of a dog's breed. There are numerous dog breeds, 
and the majority of them resemble one another. We created a Deep Learning model to 
categorise various dog breeds from an image using a dataset of dog breeds. The model 
was created using convolutional neural networks.

# Project 2:
A neural network-based model that can categorise the musical genre has been created. 
In order to classify the music genre, we have extracetd data from the audio samples, 
such as spectrograms, MFCC, etc. and then used a model to classify the genre.

# Project 3:
Fake news, a form of yellow journalism, refers to news items that may be hoaxes and 
is typically disseminated through social media and other online media. This is 
frequently accomplished with political objectives in order to advance or impose 
particular beliefs. Such news stories may make misleading or overstated claims,
become viralized by algorithms, and trap users in a filter bubble.
To identify these news, a Deep Learning model has been created.

# Project 4:
In the project, we have discussed about estimating stock return rates. We have created 
a model that can utilise the LSTM neural network to learn how to forecast stock price.

# Project 5:
To meet the demand for items based on needs, every shop must stay on top of their 
planning activities. Retailers can only determine which products are required for 
each store location by using a highly precise demand forecast. Additionally, this 
will enable capacity management, workforce planning for store employees, and high 
customer availability while minimising stock risk.
The research have made use of LSTM, which is popular for predicting and excellent
at handling time-series data.
